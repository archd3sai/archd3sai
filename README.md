### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! 👋

I am Arch and I am interested in all things data and machine learning systems. I am currently working as a Data Scientist and located in Boston, MA. In my free time, I like to read, hike, travel, and explore different music genres over a cup of tea (In no particular order).  

Check out my [Portfolio](https://archd3sai.github.io/projects/) for all of my projects, micro-projects, skills, certificates, and achievements.
