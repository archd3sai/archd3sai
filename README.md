### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Arch and I am passionate about Data Science and Analytics. I have a Masterâ€™s in Industrial Engineering from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Surat. Check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio) for all of my projects, micro-projects, skills, certificates, and achievements. 

I am currently working as a Data Scientist and located in San Francisco Bay Area, CA. In my free time, I like to read, hike, travel, and explore different music genres over a cup of tea (In no particular order).
